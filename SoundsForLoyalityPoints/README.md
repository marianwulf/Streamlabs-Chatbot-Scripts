To trigger the bot use !sound in the chat.

## Installation

1. Please copy the SoundsForLoyalityPoints_StreamlabsSystem.py, UI_Config.json and Sounds Folder into StreamlabsScriptsFolder/SoundsForLoyalityPoints 
2. Put your mp3 files into the Sounds Folder (if the filename is boom.mp3 the trigger command would be !sound boom)

3. Modify the values of the script and save it
4. Disable and enable the script to reinitialise the modified values

## Update
